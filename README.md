# diet

*diet* is a minimalistic calorie tracking program. It aims to offer the capability of remembering the total calorie consumption per day. Contrary to popular existing calorie tracking applications, it

* doesn't use an prepopulated database of foods, which are of little use if the database language doesn't match the preferred language
* allows fast definition of items without the need to first define the calorie amount per 100g if you happen to know how much calories a different portion has.
* has no long page load times that seem to be unapproriate considering the small size of information that you try to enter.
